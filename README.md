A personal portfolio website is more than just a collection of projects — it’s a reflection of who you are as a professional. It merges storytelling, branding, and technical skills into one dynamic platform. Whether you’re a designer, developer, marketer, writer, or multi-disciplinary professional, a portfolio website amplifies your reach and impact in the digital space. In this personal portfolio website, we use HTML and CSS.

Common Sections in a Personal Portfolio Website:
✅ Home Page:
The first impression — usually includes a professional photo, name, tagline, or a short introduction.

✅ About Me:
A detailed biography that explains educational background, career goals, personal interests, and values.

✅ Projects/Work:
A gallery or list of key projects, each with descriptions, technologies used, challenges faced, and outcomes achieved. For creatives, this could include artwork or photography; for developers, code repositories or app demos.

✅ Skills:
A list or visualization of key competencies — e.g., programming languages, design tools, business skills, or certifications.

✅ Resume/Downloads:
Some portfolios provide downloadable PDFs or interactive resumes.

✅ Contact:
Details like email address, phone number, social links, and sometimes a contact form for inquiries.
